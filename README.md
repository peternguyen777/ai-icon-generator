**_WoofAI_** is a micro SaaS platform that introduces a new approach to creating, sharing, and downloading pet icon art. This full-stack web application is built using the T3 stack, which includes Next.js, TypeScript, TRPC, and Tailwind, prioritizing performance and user experience.

On the frontend, WoofAI utilizes Tailwind CSS, the Shadcn UI library, and React Hook Form to create an intuitive and visually appealing user interface. On the backend, the application leverages OpenAI's DALL-E2 text-to-image generator to enhance the pet icon art experience. User and icon data are managed securely through Prisma ORM with a PostgreSQL database, and images are hosted on Amazon S3 for reliability.

WoofAI offers a user-friendly pricing model, including a free tier for platform exploration. Additional credits can be easily purchased through the integration of the Stripe API. Stripe webhooks are implemented to ensure seamless payment processing, with event data logged in the database upon successful transactions. WoofAI aims to provide accessible pet icon art, blending creativity and technology for user convenience.
